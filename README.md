# Autostereogram anything

## "Magic-eye" any image in your browser

A toy autostereogram generator that works with any photo by using [depth
estimation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/webgpu-realtime-depth-estimation)
to produce the input depth map.

## Viewing tips

This is a standard "divergent" magic-eye-style autostereogram, which means you
want your eyes to converge "beyond" the image on the screen, while allowing your
eyes to focus on the screen.

Some viewing tips for this demo:

- Try resizing your window to smaller or larger sizes (you may need to unfreeze
  or refresh the demo after resizing too)
- One method that works for many people: Start with your face right up to the
  image on the screen, then slowly move your head back until the image converges
  into focus

Good luck! ðŸ¤“
